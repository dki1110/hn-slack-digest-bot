Read data/hn_with_text.json and produce summaries in English.
All generated text must be in English.

How to use inputs:
- If source_text is present, prioritize it.
- If source_text is missing, summarize only from title/url/domain and HN meta (points/comments) without over-guessing.
- If comment_texts is present, summarize the discussion into three short sections: Pro / Con / Points.

Output requirements (must strictly follow schema.json):
- lang: "en"
- summary: 3–5 sentences. Include what it is, what’s new, and why it matters.
- bullets: ~5 bullets (max 8). Prefer concrete facts, caveats, numbers, and proper nouns.
- comment_pro: 0–3 short bullets capturing supportive arguments. Empty array if insufficient.
- comment_con: 0–3 short bullets capturing opposing/concern arguments. Empty array if insufficient.
- comment_points: 0–3 short bullets capturing key points of contention / comparison axes / unresolved questions.
- confidence: high/medium/low (lower if source_text is missing)
- used_body: true only if you actually used source_text
- body_source: copy from hn_with_text.json

Constraints:
- Do not assert facts not present in source_text/comment_texts.
- Avoid long verbatim quotes from the original text.
- Do not over-generalize fringe opinions as “the consensus”.

Return JSON that conforms to schema.json. date must be today (YYYY-MM-DD).
